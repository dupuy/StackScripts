A Linode.com StackScript shell script that configures a complete web environment with Apache, PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB, Python, mod_wsgi, virtualenv and Django.

Optionally creates a PostgreSQL/MySQL user and database and installs MongoDB NoSQL database.

By default, it creates a VirtualHost using the reverse DNS of your Linode's primary IP and sets up a sample Django project in the /srv directory.

Installs common system and dev utilities, sets up postfix loopback, Uncomplicated Firewall and Fail2Ban.

Writes command output to /root/stackscript.log and records /etc changes using etckeeper and git. When completed notifies via email.

This StackScript is a mashup of nigma's excellent system setup StackScripts (https://github.com/nigma/StackScripts) and a92bz53/steakknife's etckeeper StackScript (https://gist.github.com/steakknife/3452111).
